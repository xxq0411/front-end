                        <p>Torvalds was born in 1969 and grew up in Helsinki. When he was ten years old he began to dabble in computer programming
                            on his grandfather's Commodore VIC-20. Once in college Torvalds considered himself such a skilled and experienced
                            computer programmer that he began the insane task of developing an operating system customizable to meet his
                            own personal needs and ideas. He was less than satisfied with Microsoft's MS-DOS that shipped with his first
                            foray into the world of personal computers.

                        <p>Linus Torvalds is the creative genius behind the Linux kernel operating system. He wrote it as a part of his
                            Master’s thesis titled, "Linux: A Portable Operating System" at the young age of 21. The Linux kernal would
                            one day be the chosen operating system that powers approximately 12% of the worlds computers and an even higher
                            percentage of the servers currently in use across the internet. Upon the Linux platform, the popular Android
                            operating system found on the majority of smart phones and tablets, as well as ChromeOS from Google, have been
                            built. He was also greatly responsible for developing the GIT version control system used by many programmers
                            to develop and track issues with new and old projects alike.

                        <h3 id="where">Where is Linus Torvalds and Linux Now</h3>
                        <p>I think the best answer to this question comes from a comment made by Tovalds himself, "I was never a 'big thinker'.
                            One of my philosophies in Linux has always been to not worry about the future too much, but make sure that
                            we make the best of what we have now - together with keeping our options open for the future and not digging
                            us into a hole.</p>
                        <p> And I'm not a big believer in revolutions. What people call revolutions in technology were more of a shift in
                            perception - from big machines to PC's ,the technology just evolved, and fairly slowly at that, and from PC's
                            to the internet. The next "revolution" is going to be the same thing - not about the technology itself being
                            revolutionary, but a shift in how you look at it and how you use it."

                        <p>Windows certainly hasn't disappeared, but it's no longer the only, "gotta have it" platform that it once was.
                            Even Microsoft is venturing into the world of linux in the developer features of it's latest OS Windows 10,
                            where the Windows Subsytem for Linux can be found running Linux applications on the Windows platform. Microsoft
                            has also recently become a part of the Linux Foundation. And in the end has developed the latest .NET libraries,
                            known as .NET Core, for developers wanting to use programming languages such as Microsoft's C# to build applications
                            for the Linux desktop as well. A little fun fact in regards to these events can be found in a 1998 (19 Years
                            Ago) quote from Linus Torvalds himself.
